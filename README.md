# Email-classifier

This is a project that I implemented for my Data 100 class.

In this project, I created a model uses a test data set to create a classifier to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) emails. By carrying out the following steps:

Feature engineering with text data
- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves

I created a classification model that had a 93% accuracy on the test set. 

DISCLAIMER: During the project I was nudged in the right direction by help from the course staff.
