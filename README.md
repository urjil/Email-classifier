# Email-classifier

This is a project that I implemented for my Data 100 class.

In this project, I created a classifier that uses a test set to create a classifier to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) emails. I used exploratory data analysis techniques and feature engineering to come up with a classification model that had a 93% accuracy on the test set. 

DISCLAIMER: During the project I was nudged in the right direction by help from the course staff.
